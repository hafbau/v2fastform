# Original Prompt (Extracted from Conversation)

Help me polish the login experience for FastForm. The current UI is crap and not modern at all. I'm looking for ultra modern, clean login/signup/forgot password layout and pages - be super creative. Maybe some shaders/React background and elegant Apple level glassmorphism. The design should have understated elegance like Stripe.

When I'm not logged in, the avatar shows 'U', which is confusing. It should just show login and sign up buttons instead of the avatar. When someone clicks the avatar while logged out, it shows them the logout menu action, and clicking that does nothing.

I don't believe the forgot password flow works at all - clicking on forgot password currently 404s. The app uses NextAuth with Nodemailer for magic links, so the forgot password should integrate with that existing email setup.

For the animated background, I want a very soft animated gradient mesh like Linear.app, not particles or anything too flashy. The glassmorphism should be applied across the app, not just the auth cards. Use the existing brand palette (deep teal primary, warm coral accent) and augment with anything that works with the primary color.
